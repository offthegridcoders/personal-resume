             on as an interim-developer at Vsnap while he planned a move from Boston, MA to Austin, TX. He quickly
             picked up AngularJS (a front end framework that was new to him) and demonstrated so much ambition that
             he was hired as a full time front end dev despite the fact that he would be moving and have to work
             remotely. As a member of the Vsnap dev team Stephen was always happy to pick up any task that needed
             doing and never shy about working on things that were outside of his comfort zone. He as always very
             helpful if I ever had a question and very open to discussion when deciding the best way to tackle a
             problem. I would highly recommend Stephen and would love to work with again if
             the opportunity presented itself.</p>

          <p class="reference">Stephen did a tremendous job detailing the essential components of the campaign's website and putting
             it together in a way that was visually stunning and easy to navigate. Stephen is great to work with and
             very responsive. I would highly recommend Stephen to any candidate, business or organization
             looking to make their digital mark.</p>
