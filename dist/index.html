        <p>Stephen is super talented and hard working, and he's also just a wonderful guy and an amazing team member.
           He has the creative spirit of an artist and the work ethic of a coal miner. Absolutely a guy who amplifies
           the energy and brings great things to any team. He brought so much to our product at Vsnap, and it's a true
           pleasure to recommend him. </p>

        <h1>Christopher Swenor</h1>
        <h2>Founder of East Coast Product</h2>
        <p>It was amazing watch Stephen grow into what he is today. He started off as a Junior Developer and has grown
           into a developer that I can truly trust to make the right decisions. He has passion for JavaScript, and shows
           it in his work ethic. Vsnap is a better product because we found Stephen. He is extremely creative, and a
           pleasure to work with. I would do it again any chance I get.</p>

        <h1>Nathan Levesque</h1>
        <h2>Software Engineer at Klaviyo</h2>
        <p>Stephen is a strong front end developer who doesn't hesitate to dive in and learn backend services for
           feature implementation and bug fixes. Recently, Stephen put in a great deal of effort to identify and fix
           some deficiencies with our Jasmine-based front end tests which enabled the tests to be much more stable.</p>
        <p>Stephen is very talented in taking web designs from a designer and implementing them in a page with
           responsive design. In particular he has greatly refactored the Vsnap application's CSS to eliminate
           duplication and improve page load times.</p>

        <h1>Guillaume Delloue</h1>
        <h2>Account Strategist at Boston Logic</h2>
        <p>Stephen is a talented front-end developer with an immense appetite for learning and improving his skills.
           I can guarantee he'll be in the top 10% of the most productive developers in any organization. He's also
           a team player who's sensitive to the needs of other departments (marketing, sales, support etc.).
           Combined with his friendly demeanor and positive attitude Stephen is that rare dev talent any tech
           company would want to have. I highly recommend him.</p>

        <h1>Niksa Janjic</h1>
        <h2>Developer at East Coast Product</h2>
        <p>Stephen is a talented Frontend developer who also has a keen eye for design. As a developer at
           Vsnap he worked on a frontend part of the app developing in Angular. He is very fast at delivering
           new features and rewrote whole HTML/CSS part of the app to optimize it and improve it noticeably.
           He is capable of making pages from scratch, creating beautiful designs straight from the head. He
           also wrote lots and refactored most of unit-tests with a coverage over 90%, created bunch of directives
           to reduce boilerplate code and made sure all pages are responsive and work cross-browser. He usually
           reviewed my code and gave me ideas and advices how to improve it and made sure it is
           optimized and minimal as possible.</p>

        <h1>Ryan McDonald</h1>
        <h2>UI Engineer at DraftKings, Inc.</h2>
        <p>Stephen is a passionate, driven and talented developer. His love for programming is clearly visible
           in his tireless dedication to a project and his artistic abilities and creativity only add to his
           effectiveness as a front end web developer. Stephen and I first worked together when he was brought
           on as an interim-developer at Vsnap while he planned a move from Boston, MA to Austin, TX. He quickly
           picked up AngularJS (a front end framework that was new to him) and demonstrated so much ambition that
           he was hired as a full time front end dev despite the fact that he would be moving and have to work
           remotely. As a member of the Vsnap dev team Stephen was always happy to pick up any task that needed
           doing and never shy about working on things that were outside of his comfort zone. He as always very
           helpful if I ever had a question and very open to discussion when deciding the best way to tackle a
           problem. I would highly recommend Stephen and would love to work with again if
           the opportunity presented itself.</p>

        <h1>Chris J. Dunn</h1>
        <h2>Owner, acidotic RACING, LLC</h2>
        <p>I am happy to provide Stephen with my strongest recommendation for his website development work for us.
          Not only does he possess a tremendous amount of technical knowledge, but his personable easy-going approach
          made the creative side so much easier for us. If you're looking for a website developer look no further.
          Stephen is the guy for the job.</p>

        <h1>Pascal Delloue</h1>
        <h2>General Manager at Central Midori International</h2>
        <p>Steve was originally recommended by my son Guillaume. Steve had just started his company and I thought
          I would give him a chance. It turns out to be one of my best decisions of the last 2 years. Steve is a
          very creative, resourceful and a go-getter type individual. As a young entrepreneur he does not count
          his time nor his energy. We created a website together from scratch, developed the company brochure and
          various marketing collateral. Currently Steve is helping PICA to design a booth for a major Security
          trade-show in New York City and we have more projects in the funnel.</p>

        <p>Stephen created me a website from scratch from a small amount of specifications that I gave him and
          I ended up with something that was far more creative and interesting than I thought I needed. He was
          very receptive to my suggestions and communicated frequently to make sure the website would work for
          me and my business. I couldn't be happier with the result.</p>
